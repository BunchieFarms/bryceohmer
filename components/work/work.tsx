                I have worked on various projects in my time here so far, all within the public safety domain.
                One of the reasons I took this job was to learn how software development works in a more corporate context.
                Fortunately, I was able to join a team that enforces <b>Agile</b> principles, and I&apos;m just going to come out and say it, it&apos;s not half bad.
                I really appreciate the organization of Agile and I like the feeling of autonomy when choosing the things I work on.
                It is also nice to be a part of planning the work to be done, and using shorter sprints gives some weird sort of personal incentive to get things done in a short time frame.

            <Typography paragraph>One of the most important things I learned about Agile is that there will always be someone there to tell you that you are doing Agile wrong.</Typography>

                I have been given the opportunity to grow my skills with technologies that I am interested in.
                Another reason I started here was to get more exposure to <b>C#</b> and <b>.Net</b> and how they are used in large enterprise applications.
                I also gained exposure to legacy application maintenance, and was given responsibility over projects using technologies I previously hadn&apos;t even heard of.
                This forced me to learn many different things and gain proficiency in many skills.

                Here, I mostly work with <b>C# with .Net, SQL Server,</b> with some front-end work with <b>Javascript</b>. I do miss full-stack web development, so I stay limber in my free time.
                Sometimes, I work with legacy projects, using anything from <b>C++</b> to <b>Macro Express</b>. Have you ever heard of Macro Express? It&apos;s very useful.

                <b>My first programming job taught me a ton about software development and really taught me how to learn.
                This job reminded me how little I knew and forced me to challenge myself and grow as a developer.</b>

            <Typography paragraph>
                This was my first programming job that I got after college. I know better now, but at the time I fully believed I had no business working as a programmer.
                I didn&apos;t do any internships in college, I thought I had &quot;extensive&quot; Ruby on Rails experience (absolutely not lol), and I was working as a fiberglass laminator, making pipes for paper mills (also a great job).
                Now I know that a junior developer isn&apos;t expected to know how to breathe on their own, much less build anything from scratch, but at the time I thought I was going to get fired for not knowing anything.

                This job was great and I still miss it a bit. I was given a lot of autonomy and freedom and responsibility and was able to work with a small team of amazing people.
                I was able to meet with stakeholders, head meetings with customers, and run trainings for the people using our software.
                I worked with some very smart people that took me from a dingbat who knew nothing to a fairly competent developer.

                In my time here, I mostly worked with <b>Angular, .Net Core, and SQL Server</b>. I was also tasked with converting our web API to use <b>GraphQL</b>, which was a fun challenge.
