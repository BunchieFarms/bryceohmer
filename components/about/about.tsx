                Hello, I&apos;m Bryce

            <Typography paragraph>
                I am a husband, a father, and a software developer.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                I feel very lucky to have found a career path that I actually enjoy, and I can&apos;t really imagine doing anything else!
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                I have been learning software development for over a decade and been working professionally as a developer for over 5 years.
                In my free time, I also enjoy working on little programming projects, mostly things that are only useful to me, such as an app to see how much rainfall an area got, or how close an address is to a Target store.

            <Typography paragraph>
                Feel free to look over my GitHub, but know that I do need to clean it up a bit! The only worthwhile projects are the pinned ones, I have gotten more choosy about what makes it from my Projects folder to GitHub.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                On the rare occasion I get some free time before the street lights turn on, I also enjoy going for mountain bike or motorcycle rides, photography, disc golf, and spending time with my wife and kid.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
                I still have more I want to put on this website, projects and more about me. I&apos;m a busy boy, gimme a break!
